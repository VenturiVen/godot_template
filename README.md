# Godot Template 
Godot 2D project structure template that I use for personal projects.

## To Use
1. Click 'Use This Template' on top right of repository
2. Create your own repository
3. Clone that repository
4. Delete all the .gitignore files\* inside the empty directories
5. Rename, restructure, and remove the directories to your liking! 

\* the single .gitignore files are to allow committing empty directories

## Import to Godot
1. Open Godot Project Manager
2. Click 'Import' in the top left
3. Select the folder where your project with the template is
4. Click 'Select This Folder'
5. Click 'Import'
