#Godot Template 
Godot 2D project structure template that I use for personal projects.

## To Use
1. Download repository zip file
2. Unzip the folder
3. Delete all the .gitignore files\* inside the empty folders
4. Rename, restructure, and remove folders to your liking! 

\* the single .gitignore files are to allow committing empty folders
